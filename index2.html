                A car service is a maintenance check-up that's carried out at set time intervals (at least every year) or after the vehicle has travelled a certain number of miles. The car manufacturer specifies the service intervals by creating a service schedule that you should aim to follow. <br> <br>

                The service itself includes replacing aging parts and fluids as well as visual inspections to check key components are still working properly. It's different from an MOT test which is a legal inspection to ensure the vehicle is safe to drive based on a strict checklist of criteria set out by the Driving & Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA). <br> <br>

                Essentially, there are three different types of car service: Interim, Full and Major. When you visit different garages and dealerships, they might call their packages something different to try and put their own stamp on it. Don't be confused by this - there's always three levels in a tiered pricing structure. <br> <br>

                Each package includes everything that's in the level below with some added extras that your car will require at different stages of your ownership. The type of service you need depends on how many miles you complete in a year and the level of service you had previously. <br> <br>

                An interim car service is the entry-level package that is sometimes called a 'Basic' or 'Bronze' service. It's designed for high-mileage drivers - those that cover 20,000 miles or more a year - that may need more than one annual service. <br> <br>

Typically, an interim car service will include an oil change, oil filter change and an inspection of the car's main components, such as the lights, tyres and windscreen wipers. <br> <br>

Other key inclusions in the interim service package are the lubrication of all moving parts, top-up of the engine, brake, and other fluids and a thorough inspection for any fluid leaks. <br>

              A full service, also known as an 'Intermediate' or 'Silver' service, is usually recommended every 12 months or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first. It's ideal for drivers doing lower annual mileages who will only have their car serviced once a year. <br> <br>

It includes a wider range of checks and service replacement parts in addition to those carried out during an interim service. Below is a list of jobs that are normally carried out, but not strictly limited to:
